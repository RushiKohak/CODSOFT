# Spam SMS Detection

## Project Overview
This project classifies SMS messages as spam or legitimate (ham) using Natural Language Processing techniques.

## Objective
To build a text classification model that can automatically detect spam messages.

## Techniques Used
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression

## Dataset
Dataset used: spam.csv  
The dataset contains SMS messages labeled as spam or ham.

## Steps Performed
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Converting text data into numerical features using TF-IDF
3. Splitting data into training and testing sets
4. Training classification models
5. Evaluating model performance

## Result
Naive Bayes achieved higher accuracy compared to Logistic Regression for spam detection.
